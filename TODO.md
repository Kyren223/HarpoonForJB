* Add a Global Quick Menu (and maybe actions too?) for global files like .ideavimrc
* Add a menu to configure path replacements, ex: `$src -> src/main/kotlin/me/kyren223/trident` will replace `$src` with `src/main/kotlin/me/kyren223/trident` in the quick menu similar to how `...` already works
* Add an option (or an action) to create a shortcut automatically when adding a file, so "path/to/file.java" -> "$file"
* Keep track on the current line of the quick menu, make it persist (while the IDE runs but not after restart) and have an option to jump to the saved line next time the quick menu is opened
